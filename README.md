README for `fracdim`

## Introduction

Library on top of scipy to calculate the fractal dimension from the phase space
path taken by a dynamic system.  We use the correlation dimension method
for counting.  The library has a reasonably optimised regression and path
sampling options. On top of fractal dimension the library is capable of
estimating lyapunov coefficients for the dynamic systems.
The lyapunov coefficients are counted by delay embedding.
